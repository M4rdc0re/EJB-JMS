# Publish/Subscribe con Enterprise Java Beans (EJB) y Java Message Service (JMS)

We are going to work with the Publish/Subscribe paradigm in the EJB programming framework. We will use stateless EJB to implement an insurance quote calculation based on the applicant's age. Customers can therefore request the calculation of their premium by indicating their name and age, they can display the offers that have been released up to that point and they can subscribe to possible future offers.
